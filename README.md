# Intro

This will be a collection of my own implementation of STL features such as string, vector, for_each, array, and et cetera.

The way I've written things may (and probably will) be less efficient than what is officially implemented. Therefore, I do not recommend you use my code in production, or any efficacy-demanding environments.

This is my own personal project.

# TODO:
    The first ones I'll be doing are string, vector, and array, since they're all fairly similar.
