# Intro
This will be a collection of my own implementation of STL features such as string, vector, for_each, array, and et cetera.
The way I've written things may (and probably will) be less efficient than what is officially implemented. Therefore, I do not recommend you use my code in production, or any efficacy-demanding environments.
This is my own personal project.
